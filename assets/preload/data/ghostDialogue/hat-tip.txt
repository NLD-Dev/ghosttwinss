:bf_normal: And what’s that babe?

:tanner_happ_closed: Oh my..did we scare you by any chance..sorry about that
:marie_heh: Yeah! Our ghostly appearance catches LOAAAADS O’ PEOPLE OFF GUARD! Yet I don’t think it’s something to worry about too much!
:gf: Oh, don’t worry, I don’t think it caught us off guard.. Who are you two anyways? You seem familiar..
:tanner_suprised: Oh heavens! All this time and we had forgotten to introduce ourselves!
:noone: *Tanner clears his not existent throat*
:tanner_happ: I am Tanner.. The younger and more soft spoken of the ghost twins, and this over here is-
:marie_A2: HI THERE! I’m Marie, THE OLDER, SMARTER AND THE TOUGHER OF THE GHOST TWINS AND YOU BETTER BELIEVE I'M THE BOSS AROUND THIS TOWN!

:gf: Oh well, It’s nice to meet you both.. My name Is Girlfriend.. And this is my lovely partner, Boyfriend.. Now, what was it that you needed help with perhaps..?
:marie_heh: I dunno how your parents can name ya that..buuuuuuuut.. We here hopin' to find someone who could help us ascend outta this ghostly form and up into.. uhhhhhh..wherever ya go when ya get redeemed from this state!
:tanner_happ: Yes, indeed.. We had been trying for years on end.. But alas, nobody had been of much assistance.. Most of them would just ran away..
:marie_A2: LIKE THAT ONE GUY WHO JUST WENT SPLAT ON THE GROUND AFTER HE SAW US! OR THAT WEIRDO WITH THE RED GOGGLES WHO THOUGHT HE COULD KILL US, BUT YOU CAN'T KILL SOMETHIN' TWICE!!
:tanner_concerned: Yes.. Those times..
:gf: Well, what methods have you tried so far? I’ve heard from my grandpappy that singing was usually the way to clear the soul and return it to whence it came.
:noone: *Marie bumps Tanners shoulder*
:tanner_happ: Well, yes, we have tried singing before. But this time.. I do believe that could work!
:marie_happy: Yeah! I know it can! If I know anything about that sorta stuff (which I do) then it’ll definitely work on helpin' us out!!
:gf: Well, you’re in luck! My boyfriend here is a profound singer and I'm sure he’d love to help out as well!
:bf_normal: Beep bo skeeb do
:tanner_confused: Well then.. It sounds like a plan then!
:tanner_happ: Alright! Well, Boyfriend..
:both: SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT!
